Define an engineering problem (an example of your own) in terms of a <strong>joint probability mass function </strong>of <strong>discrete</strong> variables <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong>. (Define an at least 6×6 table.)

Find the <strong>marginal probability mass functions</strong> and <strong>conditional probability mass functions</strong> of both X and Y for your own example.

Plot the <strong>joint probability mass function</strong>,<strong>marginal probability mass functions</strong> and <strong>conditional probability mass functions</strong>, separately.

<em>Hint: You can take </em><em>Example 2.13 (M. Bayazıt, B. Oğuz, pg 32) or slides 34-39 of MAT271E_PART 3.pdf as reference.</em>
